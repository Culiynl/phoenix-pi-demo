# Ignore local secrets if they exist (except serviceAccountKey if needed, but safer to use secrets manager)
# excluding serviceAccountKey.json is safer, but user code might rely on it. 
# If user code loads it from file, it must be included or mounted as secret.
# For now, include it if it's small, but usually we ignore it and use ENV vars.
